Panoramic Image Stitching with SIFT

The problem considered in this project report is the fully
constructed panoramic images from ordered consecutive images
of the same scene. The core of this problem is feature
extraction and matching between images. Then, RANSAC
model is used to estimate mapping of pixels between two images.
Finally, blending is done to construct panoramic images.
Mathematical fundamentalsbehind the ideas of the principles
used in this paper are reviewed. Our method is sensitive to the
order of the images and will not work with unordered images.
After a short overview of the project, we go over the concepts
we have implemented or used in this perspective and then we
show our results and present our conclusion.
